We have a smart-apparel that uses infrared time-of-flight and inertial measurement units to match muscle activity and soft tissue characteristics with the wearer's kinematic metrics. The dashboard app allows a user to get a heat map of their data in real time to intervene if the system finds a statistical anomaly. The user can see things such as muscle imbalances, weight distribution during running, and fluid buildup. Our system also begins with foundational movements to develop a baseline model for the user.

The user also has the ability to share the data with coaches, athletic trainers, and physical therapists for performance and/or rehab purposes. Our goal is to help active people, especially young athletes, gain self-awareness of their body's physical performance through the use of our system. Sports medicine and sports performance personnel will have access to a dashboard that looks at the data for the whole team to determine who is doing well and who needs improvement. They can monitor the data over time, and athletes can wear the apparel during games, practices, and workouts to best monitor their overall performance metrics.
